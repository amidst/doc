Requirements for AMIDST Toolbox
===============================

For toolbox users 
------------------

This toolbox has been specifically designed for using the
functional-style features provided by the Java 8 release. You can check
the Java version installed in your system with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ java -version    

| If everything is right, the following output (or similar) will be
  generated:

.. code-block:: bash

   java version "1.8.0_73"
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.73-b02, mixed mode)   

Make sure that the Java version is 1.8 or higher. Otherwise you must
install a `more recent release of
Java. <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>`__

The second requirement consists of having maven installed your system:
`http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi <http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi%20%28follow%20specific%20instructions%20for%20your%20OS%29>`__Â 
(follow specific instructions for your OS). Use the following command
for verifying that everything works properly:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mvn -v

| which should generate an output similar to

.. code-block:: bash
