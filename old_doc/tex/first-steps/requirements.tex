\section{Requirements for AMIDST Toolbox}\label{requirements-amidst-toolbox}

\subsection{For toolbox users }\label{for-toolbox-users}

This toolbox has been specifically designed for using the
functional-style features provided by the Java 8 release. You can check
the Java version installed in your system with the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
$ java -version    
\end{verbatim}

\noindent If everything is right, the following output (or similar) will be
generated:\\

\begin{verbatim}
java version "1.8.0_73"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.73-b02, mixed mode)   
\end{verbatim}


Make sure that the Java version is 1.8 or higher. Otherwise you must
install a
\href{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html}{more
	recent release of Java.}\newline 

The second requirement consists of having maven installed your system:
\href{http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi\%20\%28follow\%20specific\%20instructions\%20for\%20your\%20OS\%29}{http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi}~
(follow specific instructions for your OS). Use the following command
for verifying that everything works properly:

\begin{verbatim}
$ mvn -v
\end{verbatim}

\noindent which should generate an output similar to\\[2\baselineskip]

\begin{verbatim}
Apache Maven 3.2.3 (33f8c3e1027c3ddde99d3cdebad2656a31e8fdf4; 2014-08-11T22:58:10+02:00)
Maven home: /sw/share/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_73, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_73.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.11.3", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"    
\end{verbatim}


Having git installed is advisable for downloading relevant material (i.e., source code, example project, datasets, etc.)  Further information can be found \href{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git}{here}.


\subsection{For AMIDST developers }\label{for-amidst-developers}

AMIDST toolbox is hosted on
\href{https://github.com/amidst/toolbox}{GitHub}. To work with AMIDST
code you should follow the
\href{https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/}{Fork \&
	Pull} collaboration model. Read this
\href{https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/}{guide} for full
details about how to fork a project and make a pull request. Once you
have forked the project, you can clone to you computer and open it with
Intellij by pointing at the pom.xml file, and everything will be ready
to start. Further details about how to contribute to this project are given this
\href{http://amidst.github.io/toolbox/ContributingToAMIDST.html}{link}.
