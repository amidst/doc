<h2 id="for-toolbox-users">For toolbox users </h2>
<p>This toolbox has been specifically designed for using the functional-style features provided by the Java 8 release. You can check the Java version installed in your system with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ java -version    </code></pre>
<p>If everything is right, the following output (or similar) will be generated:<br />
</p>
<pre><code>java version &quot;1.8.0_73&quot;
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.73-b02, mixed mode)   </code></pre>
<p>Make sure that the Java version is 1.8 or higher. Otherwise you must install a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">more recent release of Java.</a></p>
<p>The second requirement consists of having maven installed your system: <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi%20%28follow%20specific%20instructions%20for%20your%20OS%29">http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi</a>Â  (follow specific instructions for your OS). Use the following command for verifying that everything works properly:</p>
<pre><code>$ mvn -v</code></pre>
<p>which should generate an output similar to<br />
